## Getting Started

Toolbox is not build to run as a standalone but rather as part of an React application. For this in order to see it in action
you rather have to either connect it with an application locally ([see this](/docs/maintenance)) or by running the documentation
and browse around Docs or Guides sections ([see this](/docs/intro#start-documentation))


## Start documentation

In order to run the documentation of the Toolbox you have to first install all the neccessary `node_modules` for that as they will not 
be installed automatically by running yarn.

1) You must navigate to *documentation* directory and install the packages `cd documentation && yarn install`.

2) Then going back to the home directory of the toolbox you can start the documentation by running `yarn documentation:up`
