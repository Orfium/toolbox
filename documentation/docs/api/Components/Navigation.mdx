`import { Navigation } from '@orfium/toolbox';`

## Description

A UI component that handles user navigation both within the current product and among Orfium products. It is comprised of
two main parts, the **global navigation bar** and the **local navigation drawer**.

### Global navigation bar

Top-to-bottom, it consists of :

- An **hamburger button** that when clicked will toggle the **local navigation drawer**. **(Small screens only)**
- A **list of icon links** corresponding to all the Orfium products that are available to the user. The currently used product
  icon is highlighted.
- An **extra button** (![admin button](/img/admin_button.png)) that when clicked will navigate to `/admin` (configurable by `adminNavigationURLSegment`) and toggle
  the contents of the [**main navigation section**](#local-navigation-drawer) between the admin-only (`adminNavigation`) and the regular navigation (`regularNavigation`) menu. **(Admin users only)**

### Local navigation drawer

Top-to-bottom, it consists of three main sections:

- the **organisation switcher**, which allows the user to switch between the organisations available to their account. **(Controlled by** `hideOrgSwitcher`**)**
- the **main navigation section**, which lists links internal to the currently used application. Admin-only navigation will
  show up here.
- the **extra information section**, which can contain various external links to educational or support material. **(Optional)**

You can read more [here](/docs/tutorials/Installation%20and%20Usage/UI/Navigation%20Component).

:::info
Exiting the admin-only navigation by clicking the extra admin button (![admin button](/img/admin_button.png)) will take you back to exactly where you were before
entering the admin-only navigation, restoring any previously applied URL params, _as long as you navigated using only
the local navigation drawer links_.

The above works because when you enter the admin navigation the previous URL path is pushed to the history state and the
navigation links within `Navigation` pass that history state around to one another. The admin button uses the stored
URL path as its `href` value.
:::

:::caution
If your admin views have navigation of their own (by means of redirects or links), using regular
[`Link`](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Link)s, [`NavLink`](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/NavLink)s or
[`Redirect`](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/api/Redirect)s without passing around the history state will "break" the
above functionality. Use the utility components [`RedirectWithStatePassthrough`](./RedirectWithStatePassthrough),
[`LinkWithStatePassthrough`](./LinkWithStatePassthrough) and [`NavLinkWithStatePassthrough`](./NavLinkWithStatePassthrough) instead, if you want to maintain the return
URL path.

Memoising the values of `regularNavigation`, `adminNavigation` and `extras` will optimise performance.
