### Description

A UI component that handles user navigation both within the current product and among Orfium products. It is comprised of
two main parts, the **global navigation bar** and the **local navigation drawer**.

#### Global navigation bar

It lists links to all the Orfium products that are available to the user and highlights the one
that is currently being used. Admin users will also find an extra button that when clicked it will show an admin-only
navigation menu in the **main navigation section** of the **local navigation drawer**.

#### Local navigation drawer

It consists of three main sections
* the **organisation switcher**, which allows the user to switch between the organisations
available to their account
* the **main navigation section**, which lists links internal to the currently used application
* the **extra information section**, which can contain various external links to educational or support material. if the
`extras` prop is not used this section will be non-existent

You can read more [here](/docs/modules/UI/Navigation%20Component).

:::info
The extra admin button has a "resume" feature, where clicking on it to exit the admin navigation will take you back to exactly
where you were before, restoring any previously applied URL params, no matter how many times the URL changed while you were in the
admin navigation.
:::

:::tip
The above works because when you enter the admin navigation the current URL location is pushed to the history state and then all
navigation links push that history state around to one another.
If you make any redirects after clicking on the admin button, and you want to take advantage of this feature, you will
need to pass the history state between the redirects.
:::

:::tip
Memoising the values of `regularNavigation`, `adminNavigation` and `extras` will optimise performance.
