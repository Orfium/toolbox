import Type from '../../../api/_type-definitions/AuthenticationContextValue.md'

It's fairly easy to setup the Orfium One SSO using the [`Toolbox`](../../../api/Components/Toolbox.mdx). We will cover this in 5 simple steps.

## 1. Set up environment variables.

Ask \<insert name of team/person responsible for SSO, maybe like core team or something\> to provide you with the client id and domain, that is created through the auth0
applications page, for your application. These will be different for each environment.

On the created application, the team/person responsible needs to define `Allowed Callback URLs`, `Allowed Logout URLs` and `Allowed Web Origins` for your local and live urls.
They need to also define connections in the organization otherwise the application will have constant redirects.

You need to add these locally to a `.env` file that's ignored in Version Control, in order for you to develop with the authentication enabled, adding the staging and production
ones directly to Heroku or AWS, depending on what you use.

```bash
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID=<ClientId>
REACT_APP_DOMAIN=<Domain>
REACT_APP_AUDIENCE=<Audience> // optional option - default to 'orfium'
REACT_APP_ORFIUM_ID_DOMAIN=<Orfium's SSO URL>
REACT_APP_PRODUCT_CODE=<Product code provided for the project that you are using>
```


## 2. Setup Authentication

After the initial setup, you need to wrap your app with the [`Toolbox`](../../../api/Components/Toolbox.mdx) provider. Make sure to add this in the top level of your app.

```jsx
// highlight-next-line
import { Toolbox } from '@orfium/toolbox';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    // highlight-next-line
    <Toolbox>
      <App />
      // highlight-next-line
    </Toolbox>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Authentication has no props. It only takes children and provides all the necessary information for all the linked parts of Orfium.

## 3. :warning: Wait for it :warning:

It's recommended (through the [official documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/auth0-react#isloading-and-error), but also through the support forum of Auth0) to wait for the
authentication service. Make sure to add some kind of loader to the top of your application right after the AuthenticationProvider.

Example:

```jsx title="/src/App.tsx"
...
import { useAuthentication } from '@orfium/toolbox';

function Page() {
  const { isLoading } = useAuthentication();

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
...
}
```

## 4. Use the values and function provided

The hook [`useAuthentication`](../../../api/Hooks/useAuthentication.mdx) provides all the necessary information and functions to handle the authentication of a user. Some original auth0 namings are also used in our naming scheme, since they were self-explanatory.

## 5. Have a beer :beer:

Or a wine. Or a tea. I don't care. You are done! :sunglasses:

If you are not authenticated and the app is not loading, the toolbox will automatically redirect you to the Login page.

## Appendix

### Refresh Tokens

_The toolbox handles all of this logic <b>under the hood</b>, meaning that it's not required to use this function in a specific product._

By default, we use [refresh tokens](./flow#refresh-tokens). This doesn't change the way you use the app, so it wasn't mentioned before.

Let's deep-dive into the `getAccessTokenSilently` function and how it can be used in special cases.
`Authorization` goes hand in hand with the `Request` of the toolbox. Furthermore, everytime a user authenticate all the requests are automatically handling the token as their authorization bearer token.
If at some point you might make an API call to your BE using the token provided and the request will fail as unauthorized you can call the `getAccessTokenSilently` function to get a new token, this is going to be created by your refresh token _automatically_ again.
