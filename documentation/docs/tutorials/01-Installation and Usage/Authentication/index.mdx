# Authentication

## Overview

Being part of the Orfium One suite has it's benefits but it comes [with great responsibilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guuYU74wU70).

In order for a project to be integrated into the Orfium One suite of applications it **must** use the Orfium One SSO
that is provided here.

In essence, it's the Auth0 library for react, but since this might change in the future, we decided it's better to
abstract it and provide it from the toolbox library.

Authentication is handled by the [`Toolbox`](../../../api/Components/Toolbox) component.
